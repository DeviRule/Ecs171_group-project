### What is this project about?
This project is about solving the binary classification problem (fraud detection) based on the dataset retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. Please check the paper for more details.

### How to run the scripts
The file folder libs consists of multiple utility functions to draw the ROC and PR curves.
Before running the script, it is extremely important to **download corresponding processed Data folder AND dataset from Kaggle website to current workspace.**

Another repository is merged into current repository:  https://github.com/cosmobiosis/fraud_detection

Dataset Folder download link: https://github.com/DeviRule/Ecs171_group-project/tree/master/Data

Kaggle Dataset download link: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The output will be automatically saved to current folder or printed out during runtime.

### Outline
